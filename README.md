The open sea - an open source physical (3d printed) game.

## The idea

I want to create a physical game that people can 3d print. But, I also want it to be:
* Collaborative effort - people can pitch in and help. Offer changes, art and add extensions.
* Open - people can create their own versions of the game 
* Simple to play and hard to master

## Guidelines

At this point - there is no game yet. Only a set of guidelines that may change later on:

* The game pieces are tiles (probably hexagons) representing the sea, ships (representing players) and collectibles (cannons, treasure, gold, etc...)
* There would be a core-set and extensions. 
* There would be no text on the tiles. Only symbols (to make translation to other languages easy).   
* The game would have several modes of play. Both collaborative (against the clock - limited turns) and competitive (against each other)
* The game would be playable by more than 2 players together (I think that up to 4 players makes sense)
* The game would be easy to start, but hard to master (and the exensions would add layers of complexity)

## Back story 

Not yet...

## Rules 

Not yet. but I do have some ideas...
* The players are playing ships crossing the sea to try and earn gold. 
* Gold can be earned by passing merchandise from one port to another, finding and selling treasure, fulfilling quests, or by events.
* Each tile has a sea (or island or port) on top (visible side) and an event on the bottom (hidden side)
* Players can lose gold that was not stored (in port or in an island)
* Players can find upgrades to their ship, or even new ships that would allow them to move faster, see dangers, and protect themselves. 
* Some tiles are removed when encountered and replaced with new tiles, and some stay to hit the next forgetful player.
* Thinking that each turn the player can do 2 actions (move twice, but maybe other actions will also be availble)

### Collaborative mode 

The players need to win enough gold before the deck (of tiles) is exhausted.

### Competitive mode

The first player to win X gold wins
